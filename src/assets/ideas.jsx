  { 'id':31, 'Statement_id':'SIH1557', 'Title':'Development of Tyre Maintenance and Operation App, including fitment of necessary IIoT related hardware in Dumpers', 'Category':'Hardware', 'Technology_Bucket':'Smart Automation', 'Datasetfile':"NULL", 'Description':'Tyre cost is one of the most important O&M cost in dumpers. In high capacity dumpers of CIL, the tyres are imported ones, and cost of such tyre is more than Rs. 25.00 lakhs each. Two aspects are equally crucial for tyre management in a mine – The first is the proper assessment of TKPH, and the second is proper maintenance of tyre pressure. Besides these two aspects, proper tyre performance analysis is also important. TKPH:Tonne-Kilometer-Per-Hour It is indicative of how much average load is carried by an individual tyre, for a given average speed condition, during an entire shift of operation. TKPH = (Mean load on tyre in tonne) x (AWSS in km/hour) Where, Mean Load is the average load in empty condition and loaded condition, and AWSS is the Average Speed during the Work Shift. Assessing the correct TKPH requirement by the user for a particular mining condition is the most important task. The user has to seek a particular TKPH tyre from the manufacturer. Manufacturer accordingly manufactures and supplies the same TKPH tyre to the user, by using suitable tread pattern and tyre compound in its factory. More is the TKPH, more heat-resistance the tyre will be. But if the TKPH is increased just to ensure heat-resistance, then it adversely affects the cut-resistance properties of the tyre. If operating TKPH is very very less than the designed TKPH of tyres, there will not be heat- failures, but cut-failures will increase. So, there should be a balance between the heat-resistance and cut-resistance properties, and proper assessment of TKPH is a must. Actions required:The payload monitoring system has already been installed in CIL’s dumpers, and the payload as well as operating speed per shift is being continuously recorded in the Vehicle’s Productivity and Health Monitoring System. By using suitable IoT application and suitable app, the payload and speed data may be directly transferred and analysed through the suitable app, so that correct value of TKPH assessment may be made directly through the mobile app. This assessed TKPH will be very helpful in procurement of suitable tyres for a particular geo mining condition. Tyre Pressure Proper tyre pressure is equally important for tyre life. Incorrect tyre pressure adversely affects the fuel economy, as well as the performance of other vital systems of the vehicle, apart from creating safety issues also. In a big mine, regular checking of tyre pressure for all the dumpers remain a daunting task, and involves lot of time and manpower resources. Expected Solution:Suitable Tyre Pressure Sensors along with data transfer mechanism need to be installed in the dumpers, which can be used in real-time capturing of tyre pressure of all tyres fitted in the dumper. So, first of all necessary IIoT system along with hardware need to be fitted in the dumper. Next, appropriate application may be developed, to transfer the real-time tyre pressure data through the Mobile App. The real-time tyre pressure data may also be simultaneously displayed to the operator with suitable alarm system in case of low tyre pressure. In case of low tyre pressure, suitable alerts may be incorporated for Mobile App user. If such a system through Mobile App is controlled effectively by Maintenance team, they may not require to check each and every tyre pressure physically, rather they can directly identify the tyres which need immediate attention. This will help in optimum utilization of the tyre maintenance resources, and avoiding unnecessary downtime. Tyre Performance Analysis Apart from the above two aspects of tyres maintenance and operation, the Mobile App may also keep tyre-wise, its fitment position-wise records to properly assess the tyre performance and reasons of failures including premature failures, if any. Such provisioning in the App will automatically compute the individual tyre life obtained in a particular mine; and if linked to costing, it will automatically compute the cost/working hour of tyres. Such analysis will go a long way in improving the tyre performance in CIL.', 'Department':'Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited', 'Organisation':'Ministry of Coal' },

At present Methytene Blue Dye Reduction Test, commonly known as MBRT test is used as a quick method to assess the microbiological quality of raw and pasteurized milk. This test is based on the fact that the blue colour of the dye solution added to the milk get decolourized when the oxygen present in the milk get exhausted due to microbial activity. The sooner the decolourization, more inferior is the bacteriological quality of milk assumed to be. This test is widely used at the dairy reception dock, processing units and milk chilling centres where it is followed as acceptance/rejection criteria for the raw and processed milk. Further, processed dairy products may also get spoiled in the supply chain for microbiological reasons. Description:The above mentioned MBRT has to be done under sterile conditions.

Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain from Semen Production centres to the farmer's destination, where semen is utilized for artificial insemination, is crucial for the effective functioning of the Al delivery system in lndia. Semen doses are currently stored and transported using liquid nitrogen and specialized containers. However, significant losses of liquid nitrogen occur during storage and transportation, leading to escalated costs for maintaining the cold chain. The cost of liquid nitrogen itself is an issue. Mishandling of liquid nitrogen poses potential health hazards. The bulky and heavy nature of liquid nitrogen storage containers necessitates considerable resou rces for transportation. Expected solution:. There is a need to explore and promote alternative, cost-effective, and long-lasting methods for the storage and transportation of semen doses .

In fact, studies have shown that falling once doubles the chances of falling again. Many falls, however, can be prevented. One of the most effective ways to reduce fall risk is through targeted exercise that improves an individual’s strength, balance, and mobility Description:Exercise-based programs, such as the Otago Exercise Program and Tai Ji Quan:Moving for Better Balance, have been shown to reduce falls by up to 35% and 55%, respectively. Until recently, however, the vast majority of fall prevention programs were only offered in small, in-person classes hosted in local senior centres or gyms. Although this has been the standard dissemination method for decades, it comes with significant barriers to participation. Common barriers to in-person programs include a lack of programs in rural or under resourced communities; limited or no access to transportation; scheduling conflicts; cost of getting to and using facilities; interpersonal barriers, such as finding other participants’ presence intimidating; and physical environmental barriers, such as bad weather, stairs, uneven ground, difficult parking, and more The recent developments in Wearable technology with Artificial intelligence may help elderly people in preventing falls by giving tactile/visual/auditory feedback to users regarding risks of falling. This software may be developed with sensors that could able to sense whenever there is risk of Line of Gravity (LOG) goes outside the Base of Support (BOS) during day-to-day activities for elderly people as this is the commonest reason for elderly people. Expected Solution:These technologies will help elderly people to prevent falling by which Disability may be prevented. This digital delivery of a fall prevention program may be feasible. This suggests that the digital program addresses a previously unmet need in the community and its delivery would be sufficient to engage the community dwellers', 'Department':'National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (NIEPID)', 'Organisation':'Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment' },

Functional body powered upper limb prosthesis can replace the functions of upper limb for ADL activities up to some extent. But in higher level of upper limb amputation, it becomes difficult for the patient to manage ADL activities. The requirement of externally powered prosthesis such as myoelectric prosthesis plays a vital role in this aspect. Description of Problem statement:A myoelectric prosthesis is an externally powered prosthesis which is controlled by muscle contraction (muscle action potential). In market, many variants of myoelectric prostheses are available with various features. The most important feature of these prostheses is the grasping pattern types and also it indicates about movement of different fingers in prosthesis. Because it is expensive, access to these high-end prosthesesbecomes challenging for patients with upper limb amputation living in developing nations like India. Even though few myoelectric prostheses are available in market with less cost, but the features are limited and are not working precisely. Expected Solutions:Experts from different disciplines, such as engineers for creating programs and fabrication of controlling circuits and Prosthetist for fabrication of sockets and fitment of the prostheses are required to design and develop a cost-effective myoelectric prosthesis. Most important feature of the prosthesis is the grasping pattern which is completely dependent on the prosthetic hand. Thus, design and fabrication of prosthetic hand also plays a vital role in the complete working mechanism of the prosthesis. Thus, to get a successful result, it is possible to work collaboratively with experts from different discipline.', 'Department':'National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (NIEPID)', 'Organisation':'Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment' },
