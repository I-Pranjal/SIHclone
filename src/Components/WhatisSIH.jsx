          Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is a premier nationwide initiative designed to engage
          students in solving some of the most pressing challenges faced in everyday life.
          Launched to foster a culture of innovation and practical problem-solving, SIH provides
          a dynamic platform for students to develop and showcase their creative solutions to
          real-world problems. By encouraging participants to think critically and innovatively,
          the hackathon aims to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application.

          Since its inception, SIH has garnered significant success in promoting out-of-the-box
          thinking among young minds, particularly engineering students from across India. Each
          edition has built on the previous one, refining its approach and expanding its impact.
          The hackathon not only offers students an opportunity to showcase their skills but also
          encourages collaboration with industry experts, government agencies, and other stakeholders.
